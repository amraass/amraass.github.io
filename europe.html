      <b> Facts about United Kingdom</b>
      One of England’s major historical events that changed the world forever was the Industrial Revolution. Back in the 18th century, factories popped up across the country, cities grew, and life was transformed beyond recognition.     Soon, these changes spread to mainland Europe and beyond, but England is where it all began. Today, you can see the very places where this global revolution was born, in cities like London, Manchester, and Liverpool. For example, visit Manchester’s Museum of Science and Industry to understand the story of the technologies that made this revolution possible. While you’re here, make time to explore “the world’s first industrial city” itself. Manchester is an exciting and youthful destination with a lively music scene. Good to know: Besides the Industrial Revolution, many other technologies were invented in England. For example, in 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, which has changed life as we know it.
